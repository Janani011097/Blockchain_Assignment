What is your understanding of Blockchain?
Blockchain, in most simple terms, is a chain of block, where each block represents a digital information, stored on a public database, represented by the chain. This particular database is designed in such a way that it is immutable, and at the same time, transparent for everyone to see. It is also to note that Blockchain is a decentralized network, meaning, there is no middle entity acting between transactions of any sort.

Question : 5
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
How is the verifiability of Blockchain attained?
The data is stored across multiple sites throughout the internet. If any discrepancy is observed at a particular site then it can be rectified by verifying data at other sites. SO the verifiability can be attained by this technique.
Previous hash + New data = New hash
